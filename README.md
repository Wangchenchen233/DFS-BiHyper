## DFS-BiHyper: Discrete Feature Selection via Bi-Level Optimization for Hyperparameter Tuning
This repository provides a python implementation of LLSRFS as described in the paper ["Discrete Feature Selection via Bi-Level Optimization for Hyperparameter Tuning"]().

## Datasets
All data sets can be obtained from the UCI machine learning repository (https://archive.ics.uci.edu/ml/datasets.php) or scikit-feature selection repository (https://jundongl.github.io/scikit-feature/datasets.html).

## Environment Settings
- numpy
- matplotlib
- scikit-learn
- scipy
- pandas

## Running the code
Implementation of DFS-BiHyper with $p = 1$ in 
```sh
DFS_BiHyper_L21.py
```

Implementation of DFS-BiHyper with $p = 0$ in 
```sh
DFS_BiHyper_L20.py
```

You can run the following demo function directly
```sh
main.py
```
